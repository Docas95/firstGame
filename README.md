# firstGame
This project is my first attempt at making a videogame. I'm trying to learn about the LibGDX framework.

## What kind of game is it?

It's a simple block destroying game. You have a moving platform that you control with your mouse, and there's a bouncing ball and some blocks. The ball bounces on your
platform and then destroys the blocks.

Currently that's all you can do. But I plan to add a few more features so I can learn more about the framework.

## What was used to make this game?

- **Language:** Java
- **Framework:** LibGDX
-  **IDE:** IntelliJ
